# PHP + Docker + Linux + PHPMyAdmin # 

# How to run #

Dependencies:

  * Docker engine v1.13 or higher. Your OS provided package might be a little old, if you encounter problems, do upgrade. See [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
  * Docker compose v1.12 or higher. See [docs.docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you're done, simply `cd` to project and run `docker-compose up -d`. This will initialise and start all the containers, then leave them running in the background.
